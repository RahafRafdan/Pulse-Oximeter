# Pulse-Oximeter

# Description:

Our team designed and developed an advanced pulse oximeter to revolutionize patient monitoring in healthcare settings. This non-invasive device employs cutting-edge light sensor technology to provide highly accurate and reliable measurements of blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2) and heart rate. Through meticulous hardware design and integration of a sophisticated microcontroller, the device delivers real-time vital sign data with exceptional precision. Its compact and user-friendly design makes it an invaluable tool for healthcare professionals and patients alike.

# Key Features:

- Non-invasive and continuous monitoring of SpO2 and heart rate.
- State-of-the-art light sensor technology for precise measurements.
- Compact and portable design for convenient use in various healthcare environments.
- Intuitive user interface with clear and concise display of results.

# Target Audience:

- Healthcare providers and individuals requiring accurate and continuous vital sign monitoring
  
# Technical Stack:

- High-performance microcontroller (Arduino UNO was used) for data processing and control.
- Advanced light sensors for SpO2 and heart rate measurement.
- User-friendly software for device operation and data visualization.
  
# Usage:

- The device is placed on the patient's finger.
- Light sensors emit light and measure the absorption of light by the patient's blood.
- The microcontroller calculates SpO2 and heart rate based on the absorption data.
- Real-time results are displayed on the device's screen.
